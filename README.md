### Introduction
International trade takes place when countries buy goods and services from other countries. Countries sell their products with each other for the same reasons as individuals or local businesses, to have more benefits and earn more money. International trade is a driver of growth: it creates jobs, reduces poverty and opens up economic prospects.

### Background
This problem started to get worse after the 2010 earthquake where Haiti found itself in a situation where its imports are greater than its exports, and this is not a good practice for the country. Haiti is already a poor country and we need change for the country. But in order to get changes we need to start focusing on how and where we can export our products especially our agricultural products.

### Project Goals

<ol>
  <li> Analyze the dataset that we are going tocollect to better understand and give some insight on the international trade </li>
